# Location Selector
This project was part of the MATH3836 2024 Data Mining course, aimed to apply data mining techniques and startup business concepts to design an innovative data product based on Hong Kong datasets. In essence, this project mirrors the analytical work performed by data scientists at Commercial Real Estate Services (CBRE) Hong Kong, who specialize in recommending optimal business locations to clients. For instance, if a company like Pizza Express sought to establish a store in Hong Kong, they would consult CBRE, where data scientists would conduct thorough analyses to suggest the best possible store locations.

# Project Description
As data scientists starting a new business, our goal is to:
1. Design a data product for a specific application (e.g. transport, retail, etc.)
2. Download relevant open datasets from data.gov.hk
3. Apply data mining techniques to analyze the datasets
4. Propose future steps to develop the data product

# Our Approach
Our project was mainly divided into 2 parts: demographic analysis and location selector. We analyzed demographic and location data to understand customer age patterns and determine where to locate both a VR sporting goods retail store and VR sports centers.

The key tasks were:
1. Use PCA to analyze age patterns in different HK areas and select locations for VR sporting goods stores
2. Use K-means clustering to select VR sports center locations based on distances from existing sports facilities
3. Evaluate the uniqueness and impact of our VR sports business concept

# Results
The analysis resulted in proposed locations for:
- VR sporting goods stores - Both physical and pop-up store concepts
- VR sports centers - Specific buildings identified in 3 regions

# Future Work
Areas identified for future enhancement include:
- Expanding facility type analysis
- Applying approach to other industry sectors
- Integrating with mapping APIs for efficiency
