# Predicting Academic Risk

## Your Goal

Build a machine learning model to accurately predict students at risk of academic difficulty.

## The Dataset

This competition uses a synthetic dataset, generated by a deep learning model trained on the [Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success](link-to-original-dataset) dataset. While the feature distributions are similar to the original, they are not identical.

**Feel free to leverage the original dataset!**

- Explore differences between the synthetic and original data.
- Experiment with incorporating the original dataset into your training process to potentially improve your model's performance.

**Feature explanations can be found in the original dataset's documentation.**

## Getting Started

1. **Download the data:** Get the competition data (train and test sets) from the Kaggle competition page.
2. **Explore the original dataset:** Familiarize yourself with the features and their meanings.
3. **Get creative!** This playground is your space to experiment with different modeling techniques, feature engineering strategies, and potentially even transfer learning using the original dataset.

**Good luck, and have fun!**
