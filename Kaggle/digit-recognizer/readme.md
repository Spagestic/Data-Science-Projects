# MNIST Digit Recognizer

**Start here if...**

This project is the perfect introduction to techniques like neural networks using a classic dataset including pre-extracted features.

## Project Description

This project tackles the MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") digit recognition problem, the "hello world" dataset of computer vision. The goal is to correctly identify handwritten digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of images.

## What's Included

- Jupyter Notebooks with tutorial-style kernels covering various algorithms:
  - Regression Models
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Neural Networks

## What You'll Learn

- **Computer vision fundamentals:** Gain hands-on experience with image classification tasks.
- **Simple neural networks:** Implement and train basic neural networks for digit recognition.
- **Classification methods:** Compare and contrast the performance of different algorithms (SVM, KNN).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the provided Jupyter Notebooks and experiment with different algorithms.
