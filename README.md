## Data Science Projects

This repository hosts a collection of my data science projects. Each project is organized in its own folder and contains:

- **README**: Project overview, goals, and requirements.
- **Data**: Raw and processed datasets used.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Code for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

### Projects

**Classification:**

- [Titanic Survival Prediction](Kaggle/titanic) - Predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning to analyze factors like age, gender, and socio-economic status. [Streamlit Demo](https://data-science-projects-titanic.streamlit.app/) ðŸš€
- [EMNIST Digit Recognizer](Kaggle/digit-recognizer) - Introduction to computer vision and neural networks by classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Includes various algorithms such as SVM, KNN, and neural networks. [Streamlit Demo](https://spagestic-data-science-emnist.streamlit.app/) ðŸš€
- [NLP with Disaster Tweets](Kaggle/nlp-with-disaster-tweets) - Beginner-friendly NLP project classifying whether tweets report real disasters or use disaster-related language metaphorically.
- [Academic Success Classification](Kaggle/academic-success) - Predicting students at risk of academic difficulty using a synthetic dataset inspired by a real dataset on student dropout and academic success.

**Regression:**

- [House Price Prediction](Kaggle/house-price-prediction) - Predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa using 79 explanatory variables, focusing on minimizing the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between predicted and actual sale prices.
